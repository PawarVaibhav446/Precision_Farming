# Precision_Farming

Precision farming is the application of accurate agricultural inputs based on the soil, weather, and crop requirements in order to increase agricultural production, quality, and profitability. In this research, we present a technique for building a device that can measure soil nutrient contents (NPK) using optical methods. In this research, we also added a system that predicts the crop most suitable for agriculture by taking into consideration several factors such as soil ph, nutrient content, humidity, and so on.
